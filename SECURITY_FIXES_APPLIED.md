# Security Fixes Applied - October 2, 2025

## Critical Issues Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. User Preferences RLS Policy (CRITICAL - ERROR)
**Issue:** Users unable to insert preferences due to RLS policy violations, blocking signup flows.

**Fix Applied:**
- Created comprehensive RLS policies for `user_preferences` table
- Added proper INSERT policy: `user_preferences_insert_own` with `auth.uid() = user_id` check
- Added DELETE policy for user-controlled deletion
- Ensured all CRUD operations have proper policies

**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

---

### 2. User Profiles DELETE Policy (GDPR Compliance - WARN)
**Issue:** DELETE policy blocked all deletes (`qual: false`), violating GDPR right-to-erasure.

**Fix Applied:**
- Replaced absolute DELETE block with user-controlled deletion
- Created `user_profiles_delete_own` policy allowing users to delete their own profiles
- Users can now exercise GDPR right-to-erasure

**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

---

### 3. Public Storage Buckets (WARN)
**Issue:** Four storage buckets publicly accessible without authentication, exposing user content.

**Buckets Fixed:**
- `project-covers` - Now private with authenticated access only
- `avatars` - Now private with authenticated access only  
- `artist-assets` - Now private with authenticated access only
- `promo-materials` - Now private with authenticated access only

**Fix Applied:**
- Set all buckets to `public: false`
- Created secure RLS-style policies for each bucket:
  - SELECT: Requires authentication
  - INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE: Owner-only (folder-based: `auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]`)
- Content now requires authentication to access
- Users can only manage their own files

**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

---

### 4. Console Logging of Sensitive Data (WARN)
**Issue:** Edge functions logging PII (Telegram IDs, user IDs, names) to console.

**Files Fixed:**
- `supabase/functions/telegram-auth/index.ts` - Removed all Telegram ID and user ID logging
- `supabase/functions/link-telegram-account/index.ts` - Sanitized Telegram account linking logs
- `supabase/functions/handle-star-payment/index.ts` - Removed user ID and payment data logging
- `supabase/functions/telegram-share-playlist/index.ts` - Removed Telegram ID logging
- `supabase/functions/telegram-share-track/index.ts` - Removed Telegram ID and track ID logging
- `supabase/functions/delete-track/index.ts` - Removed user ID logging
- `supabase/functions/cleanup-tracks/index.ts` - Removed user ID logging
- `supabase/functions/mass-download-tracks/index.ts` - Removed user ID logging
- `supabase/functions/save-mureka-generation/index.ts` - Removed user ID logging

**Fix Applied:**
- Replaced all PII-exposing logs with generic messages
- Example: `"Processing auth for user 12345"` ‚Üí `"Processing auth request"`
- Maintained debugging capability without exposing sensitive data

**Status:** ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**

## Security Posture Summary

**Before:**
- üî¥ 4 Critical/High severity issues
- üî¥ RLS policy blocking user signups
- üî¥ GDPR compliance violation
- üü° Public storage exposure
- üü° PII logging across 9 edge functions

**After:**
- ‚úÖ All critical issues resolved
- ‚úÖ RLS policies properly configured
- ‚úÖ GDPR-compliant deletion capability
- ‚úÖ Storage buckets secured with authentication
- ‚úÖ PII removed from all logs
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 1 Minor infrastructure warning: Postgres version update available

---

## Remaining Actions

### For User
None required - all application-level security issues have been resolved.

### For System Admin (Optional)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Postgres Version Update:** Consider upgrading Postgres database to apply the latest security patches. This is a platform-level update managed by Supabase.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **User Preferences:**
   - Test new user signup flow
   - Verify preferences can be created, read, updated, and deleted

2. **User Profiles:**
   - Test profile deletion capability
   - Verify GDPR data erasure workflow

3. **Storage Access:**
   - Verify authenticated users can access their files
   - Confirm unauthenticated requests are rejected
   - Test file upload/update/delete workflows

4. **Edge Function Logs:**
   - Review Supabase logs to confirm no PII exposure
   - Verify error messages remain helpful without leaking data

## Database Changes Applied

```sql
-- User Preferences RLS Policies
CREATE POLICY "user_preferences_select_own" ON public.user_preferences FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "user_preferences_insert_own" ON public.user_preferences FOR INSERT TO authenticated WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id AND auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);
CREATE POLICY "user_preferences_update_own" ON public.user_preferences FOR UPDATE TO authenticated USING (auth.uid() = user_id) WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);
CREATE POLICY "user_preferences_delete_own" ON public.user_preferences FOR DELETE TO authenticated USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- User Profiles DELETE Policy
CREATE POLICY "user_profiles_delete_own" ON public.user_profiles FOR DELETE TO authenticated USING (auth.uid() = user_id AND auth.uid() IS NOT NULL);

-- Storage Security
UPDATE storage.buckets SET public = false WHERE id IN ('project-covers', 'avatars', 'artist-assets', 'promo-materials');

-- Storage RLS Policies (example for one bucket, applied to all 4)
CREATE POLICY "avatars_select_authenticated" ON storage.objects FOR SELECT TO authenticated USING (bucket_id = 'avatars');
CREATE POLICY "avatars_insert_own" ON storage.objects FOR INSERT TO authenticated WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
CREATE POLICY "avatars_update_own" ON storage.objects FOR UPDATE TO authenticated USING (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
CREATE POLICY "avatars_delete_own" ON storage.objects FOR DELETE TO authenticated USING (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
```
